## Homework Questions, Part 1: Ethical Considerations (50 points)

**Instructions:** For each of the following questions, provide a thoughtful (but brief) response that demonstrates your understanding of ethical considerations in data science. Your answers should reference relevant principles, frameworks, or real-world examples where applicable. Aim for clarity, directness, and critical thinking. For the examples provided with each question, discuss how they relate to the broader ethical challenges posed by the topic. Be sure to support your arguments with evidence or reasoning, and consider multiple perspectives where appropriate.  

1. How do we address bias in data science models? Example: What steps can be taken to mitigate biases in healthcare AI?
2. What are the limits of informed consent in big data applications? Example: How do we ensure consent is meaningful in large-scale social media data use?
3. How can transparency and interpretability be balanced with complexity? Example: Should there be mandatory explainability for AI systems impacting financial decisions?

  2. *The lessons learned* — Discuss the takeaways or improvements that could be made to prevent similar issues in the future.  

Your answers should be detailed and include references to relevant ethical principles, real-world consequences, and potential solutions. Where applicable, consider how laws, policies, or best practices could address the issues. The comments below provide partial answers; use them as guidance but provide expanded detail in your own words.
